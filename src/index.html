        <h5 class="mt-5 ml-5 font-bolder text-gray-400">Six Months After Job's death, the author of his best-selling biography identifies the practices that every CEO can try to emulate. <span class="text-black font-bold">by Walter Isaacson</span></h5>

        <h1 class="ml-20 mb-3 mt-5 text-2xl font-bold font-mono">His saga is the entrepreneurial creation myth <span class="font-thin text-base mb-">writ large: Steve Jobs cofounded <br> Apple in his parents' garage in 1976, was ousted in 1985, returned to rescue it from near bankruptcy in <br> 1997, and by the time he died, in October 2011, had built it into the world's most valuable company. <br> Along the way he helped to transform seven industries: personal computing, animated movies, music, <br> phones, tablet computing, retail stores, and digital publishing. He thus belongs in the pantheon of <br> America's great innovators, along with Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Walt Disney. None of these men was <br> a saint, but long after their personalities are forgotten, history will remember how they applied <br> imagination to technology and business.</span></h1>

        <p class="ml-7 mt-10 ">One of the last times I saw him, after I had finished writing most <br> of the book, I asked him again about his tendency to be rough <br> on people. "Look at the results," he replied. "These are all smart <br> people I work with, and any of them could get a top job at <br> another place if they were truly feeling brutalized. But they <br> don't." Then he paused for a few moments and said, almost <br> wistfully, "And we got some amazing things done." Indeed, he <br> and Apple had had a string of hits over the past dozen years <br> that was greater than that of any other innovative company in <br> modern times: iMac, iPod, iPod nano, iTunes Store, Apple Stores, <br> MacBook, iPhone, iPad, App Store, OS X Lion-not to mention <br> every Pixar film. And as he battled his final illness, Jobs was <br> surrounded by an intensely loyal cadre of colleagues who had <br> been inspired by him for years and a very loving wife, sister, <br> and four children.</p>
